This project contains different codes useful to modify the images taken by the martian helicopter Ingenuity. They can also be adapted to the modifications of any images if necessary. These codes are based on Python and OpenCV.

1 - Camera Calibration : This code distorts images in order to take the fish-eye effect into account and correct it. The coefficients for the RTE and NavCam cameras of Ingenuity are implemented.
2 - Batch Modifications : This file gathers many functions to modify many images with the same parameters (resize, crop, contrast, etc).
